This repository hosts the **trained 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models with internal textures** for the paper *FruitNinja*, accepted at CVPR 2025.

Our method generates high-quality internal textures in 3DGS representations, enabling **real-time slicing** and view rendering under arbitrary geometric transformations ‚Äî a novel capability not supported by previous 3DGS techniques.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The code will be released soon. For now, we are releasing the trained 3DGS models for early exploration and research comparison.

## üîç Overview

**FruitNinja** addresses a major limitation in existing 3DGS frameworks: lack of realistic internal textures when an object is cut or sliced.

- We introduce a method for synthesizing internal textures from a small number of cross-sectional views.
- The trained models support arbitrary slicing and rendering without any post-optimization.
- A diffusion model is used to guide cross-sectional inpainting, and a voxel-smoothing mechanism ensures texture consistency throughout the object volume.
- We also introduce **OpaqueAtomGS**, a training strategy that improves convergence and fidelity by enforcing atomic-scale, high-opacity Gaussian particles.

## üì¶ Contents

This repo currently includes:

- Trained `.ply` files with internal textures (opaque atomic Gaussians)
- 3DGS models for several example objects (e.g., watermelon, apple, bread, pomegranate, cake)
- Each model is trained to support real-time slicing and view rendering of both surface and internal structure
